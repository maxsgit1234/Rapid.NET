Note to self on 2025-01-25:

NuGet packages are now built automatically via project properties for both Rapid.NET and Rapid.NET.Wpf.

When deploying, increment the package versions in the project properties for both projects and rebuild.
The output will be 2 .nupkg files in the Source\bin\Nuget folder. Upload these to nuget.org after logging
in as doubledotmaxx (logins saved in the chrome profile).
